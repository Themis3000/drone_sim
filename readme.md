# Web based drone sim
#### Note: Still under development in a non-working state
This will soon be a drone flight simulator that will run completely in your browser! I am using babylon.js as my 3d engine of choice, and I am also using webpack as my bundler of choice.

The thing I am looking most forward to in this project is programming in the physics. Just thinking about how I'm going to implement the physics excites me. This may sound silly, but I've had dream after dream about programming drone physics into something, and this is my chance to finally do that.

A note about my implementation of physics:

I know babylon already has a physics engine I can use and that would be much much easier to do, but that takes away the fun part. I want to write it on my own even if it's more difficult to do and it's worse. The math excites me even though I know it's relatively basic
